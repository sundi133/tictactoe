Problem 3. 
tic tac toe:
A. WITH PRUNING: the main function whiCH checks the best furture moves is Best_MoveWithPruning(). Each of the board positions is evaluated using Evaluate() function.It also applies pruning at each level based on max or min value.

A. WITHOUT PRUNING: the main function whiCH checks the best furture moves is Best_MoveWithoutPruning(). Each of the board positions is evaluated using Evaluate() function. No pruning applied here. As seen the number of nodes expanded without pruning is much more than with pruning.
